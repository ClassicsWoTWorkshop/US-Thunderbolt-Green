Thank you for downloading!

This mod changes the color of all US tanks from their default tan/brown-drab to a gray-green color (similar to that of the M4A3E8 Thunderbolt VII). 

Included are skins for all US vehicles, matching icons for the garage and tech tree, an addon to remove the T26E5 Patriot's skin, and support for several mods (including the Dakka Improvement Project & Mirukii's M48A5, T95E2, & T34 Heavy remodels).

To install:
- Drag the "CWW-RecolorPack-US-ThunderboltGreen" folder from the included "MAIN MOD (Install this FIRST)" folder to your "mods" folder within the World of Tanks install directory (by default, C:\Games\World_of_Tanks\mods\<version>) (example: C:\Games\World_Of_Tanks\mods\1.3.0.1).

Optional:
- If you want to remove the skin from the T26E5 Patriot, drag the "vehicles" folder from inside the "ADDON - Remove T26E5 Patriot skin" folder to <Your WoT Directory\res_mods\<Game Version>\ (example: C:\Games\World_of_Tanks\res_mods\1.3.0.1\).

- If you want support for the Dakka Improvement Project & Miruku's M48A5, T95E2, & T34 Heavy remodels, drag the "vehicles" folder from "ADDON - Mod Support, place in res_mods version folder" into <Your WoT Directory\res_mods\<Game Version>\ (example: C:\Games\World_of_Tanks\res_mods\1.3.0.1\).

Enjoy!
